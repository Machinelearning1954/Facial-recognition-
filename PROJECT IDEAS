# Documenting COINTELPRO Tactics Used Against Malcolm X

Building upon the compiled evidence, this document elaborates on the specific tactics employed by the FBI's Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) against Malcolm X. These actions were part of a broader strategy aimed at neutralizing leaders and organizations within the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, whom the FBI deemed "subversive."

## 1. Intensive Surveillance (Wiretapping, Bugging, and Physical Monitoring)

*   **Electronic Surveillance:** The FBI engaged in systematic and extensive electronic surveillance of Malcolm X. This included placing bugs (listening devices) in his home and various hotel rooms he frequented. Wiretaps were placed on his telephones. This constant monitoring allowed the FBI to gather intelligence on his plans, associations, and private conversations. (Source: Wikipedia - COINTELPRO, citing Taylor Branch)
*   **Purpose:** While ostensibly for intelligence gathering, the information obtained through bugging was also weaponized. For instance, recordings of personal matters were later used in attempts to discredit or coerce targets, as seen in the case of Martin Luther King Jr., a tactic potentially considered or used against Malcolm X as well.
*   **Physical Surveillance:** Beyond electronic means, it is highly likely, given standard FBI practices at the time and the extensive file size (2,300 pages), that physical surveillance (following him, monitoring his meetings) was also employed.

## 2. Use of Informants and Agents Provocateurs

*   **Infiltration:** COINTELPRO heavily relied on informants to infiltrate targeted organizations. Evidence indicates Malcolm X was surrounded by FBI informants, potentially even within his inner circle and among security personnel. (Sources: Governing.com, NYTimes)
*   **Concealment:** The FBI, under Director J. Edgar Hoover, actively concealed the informant status of individuals involved in events surrounding Malcolm X, including witnesses to his assassination. This obstruction hindered investigations and obscured the Bureau's role. (Source: NYTimes)
*   **Potential Provocation:** Informants were not merely passive observers; COINTELPRO directives sometimes encouraged them to act as agents provocateurs, sowing discord, spreading disinformation, or even instigating violence to discredit groups or leaders. The role of suspected informant John Ali, an aide to Elijah Muhammad, in potentially escalating tensions warrants scrutiny in this context. (Source: Wikipedia - Assassination of Malcolm X)
